# Analysis of ActiWearCheck
All data and scripts needed for the analysis presented in the article *"Identifying days with valid wear for studies using consumer-level accelerometer-based activity trackers: a python library"* [(DOI: )]().  
  
**Input: [~/analysis/data.csv](https://github.com/OchaUni-Physical-Activity-Measurement/ActiWearCheck/tree/main/analysis/data.csv)** (contains all data for all participants)  
**Output: print, figures and tables in the Jupyter Notebook**  
**Script:  [~/analysis/analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/OchaUni-Physical-Activity-Measurement/ActiWearCheck/tree/main/analysis/analysis.ipynb)**  
  
- descriptive statistics
- agreement rates between 3 methods (Method1, Method2, Method HR) (Fig. 3)
- impact of using 3 different methods (Method1, Method2, Method HR) on PA parameters (Steps, Calories)
    - all days of all subjects together (Table 1, Sup. Mat 1)
    - subject-wise daily mean (Fig. 4)
    - one subject as example (Fig. 5)
